# JSKongress #DeepTrack 2019

The #deeptrack is an "open space" / "unconference" / "bar camp". That means the schedule is not set at the beginning and
all attendees get to propose and moderate a session they want. The sessions can be anything: Some people have a talk
prepared, which they had already given or want to test-drive on a smaller group of people. Another session might be a
general discussion about a technical approach you seek feedback to from people who already went that route and can tell
you up front what works and what doesn't. Hear about war stories, have a group therapy, join or start a casual
conversation about whatever topic you like.

It's purpose is to provide a setting where you can hear and share experiences. Use it to find hidden gems of knowledge
you would have never expected to get at a conference. At the JSKongress you are able to meet the creators of the tools
you use everyday and can directly ask questions why they created it the way they did. You might even be able to
contribute new ideas they are going to implement thanks to your input!

To get the most out of it: Take notes. Share your new insights with other people. Grow together and move the community
forward. Thanks for everybody contributing sessions, taking notes and sharing insights!
