# Apprenticeship program at HolidayCheck
by [Wolfram Kriesing // @wolframkriesing](https://twitter.com/wolframkriesing)

- Duration is about 4-18 months, based on the experience level and how long they should learn
- Scheduled reserved time for mentor is necessary
- Everyone is and learns differently!
- For example, use 2 month learning, 2 month internal and 2 months working on customer project
- Mentor is more a guide, not fixed schedule learning
- Mentors are volunteers
- Match mentor with apprentice during the interview process
- 1:1 always, try not to have multiple apprentices per mentor
