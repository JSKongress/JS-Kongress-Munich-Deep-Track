# Teaching how to code

## His journey of learning

- studied English literature, went with bootcamps, ...
- Wrote code on the side, then used courses, schools, bootcamps to change to a developer.
- "Founders and coders" - Learn Node, get a job
- The problem was more like you have one single technology and learn just the one they were using in the bootcamp /
  course, without getting a deep understanding of the concepts

## His proposed approach would look like

1. Teach the core concepts of the web
2. Teach HTML and CSS
3. Introduce programming
4. Interact with DOM
5. What is an SPA
6. Use React

A story was shared about a new React Developer who did not understand the underlying concepts and had trouble
understanding how other technologies worked because of that.

## Discussion / opinions about it / what others shared

- "We don't hire frontend developers" - it's better to have people understand the core concepts
- You should be able to tell if someone fits a lot faster than having them for six months
- Technology should always be teached with core concepts
- Online trainings or friends to learn? Online learning is better to begin with. In-person training is something to
  speed it up. Proper guidance helps to know what to learn next.
- Learning more as a beginner: Follow tutorials or build something on your own? "Coding is the easy part." - Getting
  creative and code something on your own is harder.
- Isn't it "demotivating" when you cannot see something getting done? You have to find the middle ground between how
  much concepts you need to build something
